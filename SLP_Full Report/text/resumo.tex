The prime objective of this Supervised Learning Project is to get an overview of high speed flow simulations using the CFD software SU2. Firstly it delves into the features used in SU2 through a simple inviscid simulation, various numerical methods used in SU2 and finally we look at the simulation of flow through optimum expanded, under-expanded and over-expanded nozzle. Then the Method of Characteristics is used to design a minimum length nozzle.
