There are 3 funtions and one main file

1) The values of number of modes, gamma, c1, c2, k and other values can be adjusted in the initialisation_variables

2) def_f and def_g are functions to evalute the functions for range-kutta scheme

3) Finally run the main.m file to run the program and compute the pressure and velocity fluctuations
